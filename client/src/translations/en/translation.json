The main objective is to foster interactions between the housed and unhoused. We are hoping the donation can be a mechanism for building these connections throughout our community.",

If you want to donate, the donation page houses each request that comes in, and you can fulfill a specific request from there.If youâ€™d like to request an item, the request page has categories you can fill out a short form to request. Once there is a match both the requester and donator will receive an email and text on when to pick-up/drop-off the item at the designated donation facility. These locations are well known established donation facilities, already in use for general donations."
